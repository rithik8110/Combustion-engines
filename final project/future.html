        <h1><u>What is the future going to be of these internal combusution engines?</u></h1>
        <p>The future of the internal combustion engines is not very bright; they are soon going to phase out due how bad they are for the enviroment. They are going to be stopped being made from a certain year, giving time for the manafacturer to get rid of stock. For example, in the UK, it's 2035. You can still own the car afterwards but not buy another one.</p>
        <p>This is all being done to introduce electric cars and non fuel powered cars into the market. These cars are going to be the normal relatively soon.Not only are these vehicles better for the enviroment but also allows for the enhancment of better modern technology. As these non-diesel/petrol powered cars are going away, the better electric cars are coming out the factories with better batteries, technology and so many more exciting ideas. </p>
